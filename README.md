# ft_select
A file browser and manager in the terminal.

-- ABOUT --

ft_select is the third project of the Unix branch at 42. The goal for this project is to learn more about screen oriented programs using termcap/terminfo libraries in the C programming language. It's originally just an argument viewer in the terminal but I decided to take it one step further and gave it browsing capabilities on the file system.
